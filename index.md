# The Corralation Analysis with QS Anthoropology Rank
![Correlation](https://zyw-mia.github.io/The-Social-Network-Analysis-of-US-Academic-Anthropology-2022/correlation/linearplot.png)

The graph above plots the relationship between a university's QS ranking for anthropology and the jobs its Ph.D. graduates get. The top 50 universities are plotted. The x-axis is the QS ranking of the university and the y-axis is the number of U.S university faculty positions its Ph.D. students get. Universities inside the U.S are drawn with orange dots, while universities outside the U.S are drawn in blue. The linear fit lines are also drawn with the corresponding colors.

The Pearson correlation coefficient between the QS ranking of all universities is -0.399. The correlation for all Top 50 universities is not very strong. Because there are many universities outside the U.S in this. Ph.D. graduates from other countries may not consider searching for faculty positions in the U.S. But if we only consider universities inside the U.S, the correlation becomes -0.716. It is a strong correlation.
Therefore, referring to this data to apply for Ph.D., if you want to stay in the United States to work in the future, the higher the school's anthropology ranking, the easier it is to find a job.

This is the graph showing that in terms of faculty number, Chicago, UC Berkeley, Harvard, and Michigan university are at the front, all over 100 faculties. Not to our surprise, Chicago University and Harvard both have impressive numbers of faculty, but the other two under discussion, Yale and Stanford are overnumbered by UC Berkeley and Michigan, which are recently expanding their abundance of subjects and the strength of the Anthropology departments. 


# The Distrubutions Comparision between 1976 and 2022
![Distribution](https://zyw-mia.github.io/The-Social-Network-Analysis-of-US-Academic-Anthropology-2022/distribution/distribution.png)

This distribution chart illustrates that in 1967, the top 4 schools of the number of graduates as faculty of any school were: Harvard, UC Berkeley, Chicago, and Columbia, while in 2022 the position of Columbia became Michigan.

Through the data of graduates from a particular school listed as faculty of any school in 1967 and 2022, calculating the mean and standard deviation of the year 2022, ùúá1=23.04, ùúé1=28.73 and the year 1967, ùúá2=31.96, ùúé2=53.38. Compared with 1976, the mean and standard deviation of 2022 degrees were 27.9% and 46.2%. It means in 1976, the average number of graduates who find faculty position is more than that in 2022 and these graduates are more concentrated in the top 4 schools. The decrease in standard deviation indicates that graduates from non-top 4 schools could have more opportunities to get faculty positions.
