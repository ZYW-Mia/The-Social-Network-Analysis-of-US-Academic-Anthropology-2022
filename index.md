# The Corralation Analysis with QS Anthoropology Rank

The graph above plots the relationship between a university's QS ranking for anthropology and the jobs its Ph.D. graduates get. The top 50 universities are plotted. The x-axis is the QS ranking of the university and the y-axis is the number of U.S university faculty positions its Ph.D. students get. Universities inside the U.S are drawn with orange dots, while universities outside the U.S are drawn in blue. The linear fit lines are also drawn with the corresponding colors.

The Pearson correlation coefficient between the QS ranking of all universities is -0.399. The correlation for all Top 50 universities is not very strong. Because there are many universities outside the U.S in this. Ph.D. graduates from other countries may not consider searching for faculty positions in the U.S. But if we only consider universities inside the U.S, the correlation becomes -0.716. It is a strong correlation.
Therefore, referring to this data to apply for Ph.D., if you want to stay in the United States to work in the future, the higher the school's anthropology ranking, the easier it is to find a job.
