Using social network analysis, we examined structural features of the network. Of the 2036 total ties,  200 originated from programs outside of the network, primarily through individuals who earned their PhDs in universities outside of the United States as well as a few who received PhDs in US programs other than anthropology. Excluding those ties was necessary to assess reciprocity and collect other measures that consider directed relations in the network.

Ties between programs are unevenly distributed because a few programs placed a disproportionate number of their graduates into other programs as faculty.

Measures of network centrality could identify how other programs influence others. Degree centrality represents the number of nodes to which one node is directly connected. The measure correlates highly with overall faculty placements in the network, because universities place more graduates at other programs are connected to more programs. Chicago, Michigan, Harvard and UC Berkeley exhibited the highest degree centrality in the whole network.

These universities were first in the field of anthropology with nearly 100-year history. They produced the greatest number of Ph.D.s in anthropology and also dominated in this field.

# Global Map of QS Anthoropology Rank

This map shows the number of QS top 100 schools owned by each country. It's easy to see that the United States is the strongest country in this field, with 39 associated schools, far outnumbering the second-placed region. The number of UK, Australia, Canada and France are 12, 8, 6 and 6. There are only a few schools in the rest of the world that can enter the top 100 in the world.

# Correlation between Rankings and Placement

The graph below plots the relationship between a university's QS ranking for anthropology and the jobs its Ph.D. graduates get. The top 50 universities are plotted. The x-axis is the QS ranking of the university and the y-axis is the number of U.S university faculty positions its Ph.D. students get. Universities inside the U.S are drawn with orange dots, while universities outside the U.S are drawn in blue. The linear fit lines are also drawn with the corresponding colors.

  The Pearson correlation coefficient between the QS ranking of all universities is -0.399. The correlation for all Top 50 universities is not very strong. Because there are many universities outside the U.S in this. Ph.D. graduates from other countries may not consider searching for faculty positions in the U.S. But if we only consider universities inside the U.S, the correlation becomes -0.716. It is a strong correlation.
Therefore, referring to this data to apply for Ph.D., if you want to stay in the United States to work in the future, the higher the school's anthropology ranking, the easier it is to find a job.

# Dynamics Development (1976 and 2022)
## Number of Positions Comparision

By comparing the distribution between the faculty positions of each university owning Anthropology department in 1976 and 2022, we find that the extreme centralization of the academic resource has been alleviated. From the tree maps, it is obvious that in 1970s, the four universities each possessed over or very close to 200 positions, which almost doubled the 5th place, Michigan University. Furthermore, the first four account for over 40 percent of all faculty positions, while in 2022, this figure falls to around one quater.

## Distrubutions Comparision
This distribution chart illustrates that in 1967, the top 4 schools of the number of graduates as faculty of any school were: Harvard, UC Berkeley, Chicago, and Columbia, while in 2022 the position of Columbia became Michigan.

  Through the data of graduates from a particular school listed as faculty of any school in 1967 and 2022, calculating the mean and standard deviation of the year 2022, ùúá1=23.04, ùúé1=28.73 and the year 1967, ùúá2=31.96, ùúé2=53.38. Compared with 1976, the mean and standard deviation of 2022 degrees were 27.9% and 46.2%. It means in 1976, the average number of graduates who find faculty position is more than that in 2022 and these graduates are more concentrated in the top 4 schools. The decrease in standard deviation indicates that graduates from non-top 4 schools could have more opportunities to get faculty positions.
