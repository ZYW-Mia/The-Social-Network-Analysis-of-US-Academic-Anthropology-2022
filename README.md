## Introduction
This page mainly explores the current hiring social network and historical trend of the U.S acedemic Anthropology. Firstly, our team notice that the job perspective of Anthropology graduates are not satisfying, only 8 percent of which remain digging into this field, generally lower than average. Therefore, we wonder what elements drove this field to the situation and intend to get a deep understand in hiring networks in anthropology, as well as analyze changes in anthropology faculty placements and network structures over the past five decades.

## Dataset
Through official websites of the Department of Anthropology, we collected information on all tenured track faculty in all PhD-granting anthropology programs in the United States, for a total of 2036 individuals.

For each faculty member, we paid particular attention to the institution they are currently affiliated with and the institution where they received their PhD.
