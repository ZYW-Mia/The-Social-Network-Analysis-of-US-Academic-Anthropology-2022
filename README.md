# The Social Network Analysis of US Academic Anthropology 2022
This is a joint work by Huangjin Zhu, Yang Zhao, Yawen Zhao, Junyu An, Xiaoyong Zhou for 2022 KU Leuven Data Visualization Group Assignment (Group 8).

The visualized results are published on [Github Page](https://zyw-mia.github.io/The-Social-Network-Analysis-of-US-Academic-Anthropology-2022/).

## Introduction
This page mainly explores the current hiring social network and historical trend of the U.S acedemic Anthropology. Firstly, our team notice that the job perspective of Anthropology graduates are not satisfying, only 8 percent of which remain digging into this field, generally lower than average. Therefore, we wonder what elements drove this field to the situation and intend to get a deep understand in hiring networks in anthropology, as well as analyze changes in anthropology faculty placements and network structures over the past five decades.

#### The four parts of the website are:

#### 1.Social network graph (our main visualization topic)
#### 2.Global Map of QS Anthoropology Rank
#### 3.Correlation between Rankings and Placement
#### 4.Dynamics Development (1976 and 2022):
#####  -Number of Positions comparison
#####  -Distribution comparison


## Research Questions
### Who get hired?
- Which programs are most successful at placing their graduates as faculty in other PhD-granting programs?
### Who hired whom?
- How is the hiring network organized?
### Why they get hired?
- Does ranking matter during the hiring process? 
### Dynamics development 
- Compared with the results from 1976, how has the networked changed?

## Dataset
Through official websites of the Department of Anthropology, we collected information on all tenured track faculty in all PhD-granting anthropology programs in the United States, for a total of 2036 individuals.

For each faculty member, we paid particular attention to the institution they are currently affiliated with and the institution where they received their PhD.
